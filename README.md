Scrape - opening, close , volume , high low at the end of the day 
Decide to invest / sell / watch
limit the variance in opening price

Algorithm
Testing
Functionality to Buy & Sell





Future Versions: 
1. How much to buy and sell?
2. Can the algorithm automatically run at certain point of the day to 
3. System to capture transaction cost to purchase or sell the equity or MF
4. Train itself to improve
